[DONE] * Ribbon buttons do not depress - added STYLE_PUSH
[DONE] * Bug: close shell, answer 'no' in dialog -> exception
[DONE] * Show window menu when ALT is pushed down
[DONE] * Quicktoolbar: no visual feedback on push - works in demo - need to check
[DONE] * Sync ribbon tab with active perspective -> perspective listener
[DONE] * Edit Tab: make 'open type' big and 'find' small
[DONE] * Jumping on menu-reveal is distracting - fix

Committed:
* Finish 1st iteration of the tabs
* Hook buttons to the commands
* QuickAccessToolbar: need run, debug icons
* QuickAccessToolbar: separator element
* Add keybinding info to tooltip
* 'Eclipse' Window and System icons (task switcher, task bar)
* Ribbon: button should fire on mouse up, _not_ on mouse down

Bugs:
* QuickAccessToolbar: tooltips do not work
* QuickAccessToolbar: push mouse button down, move mouse -> will drag window
* BigButton stuck hover: click BB, click on view, hover still there, move cursor 
  to Ribbon, hover updated -> try a close listener on the BB-menu, reset/repaint hover on close 
* It seems that the image/text on large toolbar buttons is not always aligned -> check
* Arrow on large split buttons is not always centered: check 'Run' button
* Pause exec, Drop To Frame enabled after exec finished

Ideas:
* About Ribbon: Help menu entry
* Update check
   - do not use p2/UM; just get a textfile from server
   - ask for permission, store preference, needs preference page
   - 1st iteration: dialog, 2nd: use notification area
* Feedback / Donation reminder
   - write timestamp to instance location
   - 1st iteration: dialog, 2nd: use notification area
* Custom Presentation: local toolbar hidden by default -> removes clutter, better vspace usage  
* Shell: cheese/flicker on resize - should use an SWT Tracker
* Replace gray menus with - nice looking menus for Big Button, Split Arrow Button - see Chrome 3.0 omnibar menu (slightly transparent)
* Do we need a 'catch all' tab for all other perspectives?
* 'Run tests' button on the ribbon, should show feedback (green / red)
* Ambient information (AI) + notifications (NF):
  - AI: could live on the ribbon: build status, recent commits, mylyn
  - AI: could use the big button; example for build status
  - maybe we just have one status area that shown different notifications / 'unread' messages indication
    - this could be extensible for build, mylyn, commits, etc.
  - most recent notification could be shown on
    - the RHS - at the height of the tabs +1
    - the status bar (mhh)
* Bugzilla element for Ribbon? (search # or text, create new bug) 
* Customization mechanism (ext. point and behavior)
Dev:
  1. You should be able to define new tabs
  2. You should be able to define new groups
  3. You should be able to associate groups with tabs
     - have visible by default true/false flag 
  4. You should be able to associate perspectives with tabs
  5. You should be able to arrange groups by drag & drop
User:
  6. Tab settings should persist
  7. Reset tab
  8. Add/remove groups from tab, via arrow pop-up menu
* Fade-in / fade-out for tooltip? -- see tooltips in eclipse toolbars
? Extend RibbonToolTip to work as a regular tooltip too - don't always need the large tt
